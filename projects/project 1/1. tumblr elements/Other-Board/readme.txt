HOW TO INSTALL A TUMBLR THEME:

1. Download the theme to your computer.

2. The theme will be dowloaded to your computer. If the file is a zip file, unzip it.

3. There should be one .html file after unzipping. Open the .html file in a text editor. We recommend Textedit for the Mac or Notepad on the PC.

3.1 If you are using Textedit make sure you open the file with the right settings. To do so open Textedit then goto -> Preferences -> Open and Save, and make sure 'Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text' is checked and then when you open the html file again it will be displayed correctly.

4. After you've opened the file, you should be looking at a bunch of HTML. This is the theme code. The entire document should be highlighted (command+A on the Mac or ctrl+A on the PC) and copied (command+C on the Mac or ctrl+C on the PC).

5. Login to Tumblr (if you haven't already). Do one of the following:
	Choose your blog from the menu on the top right of the Dashboard, then click “Edit appearance.”

	Click the Edit Theme button (yourblog.tumblr.com).

6. You should now be looking at your blog's customize options. A theme will already be installed. Regardless, click on the Edit HTML link below the theme name.

7. Now you will be looking at a bunch of HTML. Remove all of the HTML that you are looking at and paste the HTML that you copied from your text editor.

8. Click the Update Preview button. If it looks good, then click Save.

9. Congrats! Your theme is now installed.
