<p>Piranhas, the "wolves of the water," are known for their ability to strip an animal to the<br />bone in mere seconds. They aren't actually as dangerous to humans as you'd think,<br />especially if you swim with them during the wet season when they have plenty of food.<br />Still, South American shoals of piranhas can be dangerous when food is scarce. If<br />you're going to take a dip in the Amazon, read on to see how you can swim peacefully<br />with piranhas.</p>

<li><p id="step1"></p><b>Get familiar with piranha territory.</b> Piranhas are freshwater fish and live only in<br />South America (although occasionally a stray pet piranha turns up in a river<br />elsewhere). Residing almost exclusively in still or slow-moving streams or lakes,<br />they usually die in cold water.</p><br />

<li><p id="step2"><b>Avoid swimming with piranhas in the dry season.</b> Piranhas are usually<br />mild-mannered and skittish. They rarely, if ever, attack a much larger animal unless they<br />are starving. Food supplies are at their lowest during the dry season (which lasts from<br />around April to September) when water levels fall dramatically and food is less plentiful,<br />so avoid entering piranha-infested waters during these times.</p><br />
	<ul>
	<li>If you're in doubt about whether the dry season is still underway,<br />ask local residents if it's safe to swim.<br />
</li>
	<li>Be wary of ponds that seem to be a product of the movements of a<br />river. Rivers slowly move back and forth and often shrink and grow<br />with the rain, leaving temporary ponds behind. Fish in these waters<br />are isolated from other water sources and are essentially<br />condemned to death; they could jump and attack you out of sheer<br />desperation if you stand close enough.<br /></li>
	</ul>


	<img src="images/image_3.jpeg" alt="Wait until night to enter the water" width="728" height="546">
<li><p id="step3"><b>Wait until night to enter the water.</b> If, during the dry season, you must venture into<br />water inhabited by piranhas, wait until darkness before attempting to traverse without a<br />boat. Piranhas hunt in the day and sleep at night.</p><br />
	<ul>
	<li>If awakened from their slumber while it's dark, piranhas will<br />generally flee, but it's safest not to disturb them.<br /></li>
	<li>Remember that other predators, such as caimans, are more active<br />at night. If attempting to cross a waterway with a diversity of<br />organisms, the dangers of traveling at night may far outweigh the<br />benefits.<br /></li>
	</ul>
	<img src="images/image_4.jpeg" alt="Stay out of the water if you have an open, bleeding cut" width="728" height="546">
<li><p id="step4"><b>Stay out of the water if you have an open, bleeding cut.</b> Piranhas sense blood in<br />the water and are more likely to attack a larger animal if they think it's wounded.</p><br />
	<ul>
	<li>You should also avoid carrying raw meat into the water, and wash your<br />hands before entering if you have recently handled raw meat. (Don't<br />wash where piranhas reside).<br /></li>
	<li>Steer clear of waters below bird nesting areas, docks where fish are<br />gutted, and garbage dumps; you don't want the piranhas to associate you <br /> with the blood that could come from these sources.<br /></li>
	</ul>

	<img src="images/image_5.jpeg" alt="Avoid making a fuss" width="728" height="546">
<li><p id="step5"><b>Avoid making a fuss.</b> Recent studies suggest that desperate piranhas are attracted<br />more by activity than by blood. When crossing water, minimize your movement and<br />swim or walk with smooth, fluid motions. Avoid talking, and don't use flashlights or<br />lanterns when night-crossing.</p><br />

	<img src="images/image_6.jpeg" alt="Create a diversion" width="728" height="546">
<li><p id="step6"><b>Create a diversion.</b> As a last-ditch effort, try to create a diversion by releasing an<br />animal carcass or a substantial quantity of raw meat downstream from your desired<br />crossing point. Should such action become necessary, keep in mind that piranhas can<br />strip animals to the bone in a matter of minutes or even seconds, so you'll want to cross<br />very quickly before they sense you.</p><br />
